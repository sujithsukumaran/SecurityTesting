INFORMATION GATHERING PHASE

(i) Technology stack
(ii) Operating system
(iii) Server details
(iv) shared hosting or dedicated hosting
(v) what ports are being used and their status
(vi) port scan

TECHNOLOGY STACK

--> builtWith --> chrome plugin OR web browser

--> whatRuns --> chrome plugin [installed, inspected, emailed, https://www.whatruns.com/website/incedoinc.com]

--> Wapalyzer --> chrome plugin [installed, inspected, exported the test report.csv]
etc

--> Webspotter technology checker & email lookup  --> Chrome plugin [installed, inspected]


Target ==> this is the AUT [application under test]


Bug#1 : The tech stack details are exposed to public users in https://www.incedoinc.com

Bug#2: The email address of the company employees is exposed to public users in https://incedoinc.com

====================

operating system detection

refer : https://subinsb.com/default-device-ttl-values/

https://ostechnix.com/identify-operating-system-ttl-ping/

TTL -- time to live

TTL ~ < = 60-70 ==> Linux OS

TTL  ~ > 110 ==> Windows OS

The default initial TTL value for Linux/Unix is 64, and TTL value for Windows is 128.


Use the PING utility in COMMAND PROMPT and identity the TTL value to know the OS of the server, where the target AUT is hosted

=======================

Server details

visit https://whois.domaintools.com/ to get the target AUT server details

visit https://www.yougetsignal.com

server ip: 52.5.164.217
Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
AWS-Virginia, USA

Bug#3: The target AUT is redirected to domain name when executed with ip address 52.5.164.217

Bug#4: The OS and the server details are exposed to public users during server details detection technique in info gather phase

=========================

Port: A port signifies the functionality/service that the AUT can offer

port numbers range is 0 to 65345

port 1 to 1024 ==> frequenlty ports being used

Well-known ports range from 0 through 1023.
Registered ports are 1024 to 49151.
Dynamic ports (also called private ports) are 49152 to 65535.

https://www.webopedia.com/reference/well-known-tcp-port-numbers/#:~:text=Port%20numbers%20range%20from%200,designated%20as%20well%2Dknown%20ports.

port = 22 = ssh
port = 80 = http
port = 443 = https
port = 21= ftp
port = 25, 465, 587, 2525 = smtp

port status = OPEN, CLOSED, BLOCKED, UNAVAILABLE

shodan app --> chrome plugin

find port numbers which are used

find which version of https [ssl/tls] is being used

find any vulnerabilties in the frameworks used 

shodan.io

HTTP(s)

s = SSL [deprecated] or TLS [latest]

TLS v1.0 [buggy]
v1.1 [buggy]
v1.2 [buggy]
v1.3 [latest]

Bug#5: TLSv1.2 is used for the AUT [incedoinc.com] instead of using the latest version of TLS which is v1.3
